Assignment 5: Dungeon of Doom!

Dee Turco
Kishan Vekaria
Jeff Stockman

Jeff - 38 hours
- UML
- dungeon.py
- dungeon_adventure.py
- debugging

Dee - 48 hours
- UML
- room.py
- GUI (attempted, not complete)

Kishan - 25 hours
- UML
- adventurer.py

Shortcomings:
- change to your instructions: "o" is used for exit instead of "O"
- didn't attempt unit tests (we are starting strong with our bad habits)
- GUI not completed - we got to the point of dungeon creation to the frame; we print the dungeon and action buttons, then that's it --- it should have printed the current room / entrance; we did not solve the game via GUI

Additional info:
Hidden menu items: at user input, type "map" to print the dungeon, or "vision" [no quotations] to use the vision potion (hey, no cheating!)
- easter egg: type "python" at user_input and enjoy!


Considerations:
- we'd like to see other teams' dungeons; how they constructed it, best practices, etc.
- perhaps a conversation/presentation for next quarter...?
- how in the world do you create the vision potion string in fewer than 600 lines of code (Jeff)?!

Happy Holidays --- see you in 2021!
