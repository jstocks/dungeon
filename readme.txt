Assignment 5: Dungeon of Doom!

Dee Turco
Kishan Vekaria
Jeff Stockman

Jeff - 30 hours
- UML
- dungeon class
- dungeon adventure.py
- debugging

Dee - 48 hours
- UML
- room class
- GUI (attempted)

Kishan - 25 hours
- UML
- adventurer class
- dungeon adventurer

Shortcomings:
- adventurer takes damage if in pit room and moves in an invalid direction
- dungeon randomly places H potion and doesn't mark on map
- dungeon creation sometimes places pit at entrance
- doesn't print original game board on win/loss
- how in the world do you "use" vision potion in fewer than 600 lines of code?!
- note: "o" is used for exit instead of "O"

Additional info:
Hidden menu items: at user input, type "map" to print the dungeon, or "vision" [no quotations] to use the vision potion (hey, no cheating!)

Considerations:
- we'd like to see other teams' dungeons; how they constructed it, best practices, etc.
	- perhaps a conversation/presentation for next quarter...?
