Shortcomings:
- found an instance where dungeon randomly places H potion and doesn't mark on map
- dungeon creation sometimes places pit at entrance
- doesn't print original game board on win/loss; only entrance & exit and any items not picked up
- change to your instructions: "o" is used for exit instead of "O"
- didn't attempt unit tests (we are starting strong with our bad habits)

Additional info:
Hidden menu items: at user input, type "map" to print the dungeon, or "vision" [no quotations] to use the vision potion (hey, no cheating!)
- easter egg: type "python" at user input and enjoy!


Considerations:
- we'd like to see other teams' dungeons; how they constructed it, best practices, etc.
- perhaps a conversation/presentation for next quarter...?
- how in the world do you create the vision potion string in fewer than 600 lines of code?!
